# <u>**HBM Nuclear Tech Mod - 1.12.2 Extended Edition**</u>

This is my 1.12.2 custom version of the mod, 
where I attempt to add features from Hbm's original 1.7.10 version and add QoL features.
Planning to contribute to Alcater's fork.

which is forked from the fork made by [Alcatergit](https://github.com/Alcatergit/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is forked from the fork made by [TheOriginalGolem](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is forked from the port made by [Drillgon200](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is ported from the original mod made by [HBMTheBobcat](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).


### **Build Guide:**

Download the repository, then open a shell prompt in that folder, then type the following:

`.\gradlew build`

Press enter.

Now just wait for the build to finish and the new Jar file will be in `Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT\build\libs`.
